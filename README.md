# React Product List

This is a starter project for a React challenge. The goal is to create a page that displays a list of **products** and a list of **categories** for those products. Clicking one of the category buttons should filter the list of products display to only display products in that category. 

**Getting Started**

1. Fork this Repo.
1. Post a link to the progress tracker for class.
1. `npm install` to install dependencies
1. `npm start` to run the project at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

From here as you work you should see changes refresh in the browser as you save files. If there is an error you will see this in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App see the notes [here](notes/create-react-app-notes.md) for more information.


# As there were no photos of produts in APi, have displayed Description of products
